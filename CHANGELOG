version 0.3.1
- fixes cli command "assistant server" with given port (@AndChr)
- makes levenshtein comparison in entity dictionary case-insensitive

version 0.3.0
- promisifies hook api: Hooks aren't based on success() and failure() callbacks anymore, returning a Promise<boolean> instead
- introduces beforeIntent_ and afterIntent_ methods: These methods may be implemented in states and are called before/after an intent. This may be a good alternative for state-dependent hooks.
- fixes translateValuesFor/translateHelper call dependency bug
- adds device recognition: Platforms are now able to emit a device name which can be used to implement device-specific behaviour
- adds device-specific translation convention: If there is a device, AssistantJS will automatically look up keys structured like state.intent.{key}.platform.device
- enhances BaseState: BaseState now supports abbrevations for ResponseFactory (this.prompt(), this.endSessionWith()), TranslateHelper (this.t()), platform/device recognition (getPlatform(), getDeviceOrPlatform()) and logging (this.logger)
- groups state interfaces to a State namespace (State.Required, State.ErrorHandler, State.BeforeIntent, ...)
- adds unique short requestId to RequestContext
- switches to production-ready logging through bunyan: Removes dependency of "debug" module, adding bunyan instead.
- makes bunyan instance configurable through "core:root"-configuration
- makes logger instance injectable in all classes (as well in root as in request scope)
- adds the current request's id, an unique session identifier (not the session id) and the current platform/device as default parameters to request-specific logger
- makes logging opt-in-able in specs via environment variable SPEC_LOGS=true
- enables component-specific logging (especially for external assistantjs components)
- adds extension point enabling other components to add middlewares to request-specific logger
- enables whitelisting of specific extraction elements with logger, uses reasonable secure default
- changes featureChecker to use type guards
- updates multiple dependencys (esp. typescript)
- changes structure of configuration interfaces to improve type safety and user handling, now seperating between Configuration.Defaults and Configuration.Required and deriving Configuration.Runtime and user configuration
- deprecates interface exports (rootInterfaces, servicesInterfaces, unifierInterfaces, ...), now exporting all interfaces directly
- restructures internal interfaces, splits them up into public-interfaces (which are exported) and private-interfaces (which aren't)
- moves all interfaces needed for platform generators into single PlatformGenerator namespace
- updates scaffolding to generate new 0.3.0 structures in generated projects
- adds interfaces for internal hooks, making them type-safe
- adds cli command to list extension points and components

version 0.2.7
- removes local references from package-lock.json
- adds default port to fakredis spec instance, bugfixing fast mode

version 0.2.6
- executes registerInternalComponents() only if not done already by developer, giving him/her more flexibility

version 0.2.5
- makes tests faster
- updates inversify-components
- uses fast-option for fakeredis in default configuration

version 0.2.4
- switches to fakeredis as default configuration, lowering the barriers to entry

version 0.2.3
- sample selection now prefers array syntax over template syntax:
  When translateHelper draws a translation, it first looks out for the translation array and grabs a sample,
  before evaluating the sample's template syntax. This changes the probabilities of translation entries.

version 0.2.2
- enhances platform-specific i18n translations
- enables i18n data models
- fixes bug causing filtering of all entities in logs

version 0.2.1
- fixes bug which changed values of entities named "password", "pin" or "secure"

version 0.2.0
- adds interfaces for chat text, reprompts and suggestion chips
- introduces state transition history
- adds interfaces for session factory and current session factory
- response objects can now ignore unsupported platform features
- adds code examples to readme

version 0.1.2
- bugfix: additional arguments of intent methods are now passed to hooks, too

version 0.1.1
- introduces changelog
- adds redis configuration to scaffold
- removes redis default configuration
- removes redis dependency for assistant cli

version 0.1.0
- first initial public release
