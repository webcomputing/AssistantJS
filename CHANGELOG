version 0.4.1
- fixes two scaffolding errors

version 0.4.0
- changes default behaviour of AssistantJSSetup's constructor to create a new container instead of using a global one. Removes global container.
- changes get() and getRaw() methods of entity dictionary: Now casting returned numbers to strings, aligning both methods to the already specified return type (string|undefined). Previously, if entities in request/extraction have been numbers, dictionary did not return them as string, resulting in unexpected/untyped behaviour.
- changes get() method of entity dictionary: If you are getting an assistantjs-configured custom entitiy and user passed a synonym of an entity value, get() automatically resolves to the entity value. Use getRaw() f you want to get the original passed value.
- changes get() method of entity dictionary: If you are getting an assistantjs-configured custom entitiy, get() now always return the value with the nearest levenshtein distance instead of the original value. If you want the original value, use getRaw() instead. For non-custom-entities, get() returns the regular value.
- adds listKeys and getSubset to session interface
- introduces translateHelper's getAllAlternatives() method which returns all alternatives instead of a sample one. Useful for suggestion chips etc and as an alternative to getTranslationValuesFor.
- changed the "assistant" binary to load the new application-initializer.js instead of index.js. To migrate, install the new assistant-source version globally.
- the entry files for utterances/translations/entities now may be either .json, .js or .ts files
- now supports generation of custom entities
    - You are now able to define custom entities in a config/locales/en/entities.ts file (or .json, or .js). If you wonder how, just generate a new assistantjs application and have a look at the used interface in the generates entities.ts file.
    - Remember that you need to set up a type mapping in your unifier configuration in config/components/unifier for your custom entities, too.
    - You do not need to set up platform specific mappings (for dialogflow, alexa, ...) for your custom entities. 
    - On the other hand, if you set up a platform specific mapping, our generators will use this platform specific mapping instead of your custom entity. This enables you to use custom entities as a fallback for missing platform specific types. For example, if you use the AMAZON.US_CITY slot type, but don't find a corresponding dialogflow entity for it, you are able to create a custom entity as a dialogflow fallback.
- changed spec setup and made spec-helper more powerful. To make use of the improved spec setup in your 0.3.x project, create a new assistant js application and have a look at the generated spec setup.
- renames "specSetup" to "specHelper" and removes autoStart option of pretendIntentCalled() in PlatformSpecHelper interface (unifierInterfaces)
- removed index.ts and replaced it with application-initializer.ts to make the AssitantJS initialization process more adaptable. To migrate easily, create a new AssistantJS application, copy the created application-initializer.ts, paste it into your application and merge all locally made changes of your index.ts into your new application-initializer.ts
- renamed SpecSetup to SpecHelper
- new ResponsHandler: ResponseFactory and old Response-Types are obsolete now. A new ResponseHandler is introduced, which allows you the following:
    - Method-Chaining `this.handler.prompt(...).setCard(...).setSuggestionChips(...)`
    - dynamic types and methods based on the installed and used platforms `this.handler.addGoogleTable(...).addAlexaList(...)`. To Work you have to specif a intersection-type like `type MixedTypes = GoogleSpecificTypes & AlexaSpecificTypes; type MixedHandler = GoogleHandler<MixedTypes> & AlexaHandler<MixedTypes>;`
    - every Method can be used either with plain objects or with promises
    - for every common feature like SuggestionChips, Authentication or Cards there is a mixin which can be used and extended by specific ResponseHandler
    - removed createAndSendEmptyResponse(), use endSessionWith("") instead.
    - as of https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/17113 projects need to use `"skipLibCheck": true` in tsconfig.json
    - add SelectedGenericIntent for selection of items, e.g. a list on a smart display
- introduces @stayInContext and @clearContext decorators, which enables you to have multiple states active at the same time
- adds specs to scaffolding process
- adds status for accountlinking as optional extraction
- substitutes alexa-utterance dependency with own implementation
- allows integration of missing interpolation handlers to use fallback / default translations
- makes translateHelper's t() method async
- removes redis and fakeredis dependencies
- introduces platform session, crypted platform session and redis based session storage
- adds BeforeStateMachine and AfterStateMachine extension points
- adds possibility to use platform sessions, for example session system of alexa or google assistant, and makes platform sessions the default session storage
- introduces @filter decorator, which works like a beforeIntentHook, but is made specifically for state redirections (which should be the most common use case for hooks)
- minor changes and improvements    

version 0.3.2
- fixes intent configuration in generator. Entities will be mapped with utterances only once. (@denselmann)

version 0.3.1
- fixes cli command "assistant server" with given port (@AndChr)
- makes levenshtein comparison in entity dictionary case-insensitive

version 0.3.0
- promisifies hook api: Hooks aren't based on success() and failure() callbacks anymore, returning a Promise<boolean> instead
- introduces beforeIntent_ and afterIntent_ methods: These methods may be implemented in states and are called before/after an intent. This may be a good alternative for state-dependent hooks.
- fixes translateValuesFor/translateHelper call dependency bug
- adds device recognition: Platforms are now able to emit a device name which can be used to implement device-specific behaviour
- adds device-specific translation convention: If there is a device, AssistantJS will automatically look up keys structured like state.intent.{key}.platform.device
- enhances BaseState: BaseState now supports abbrevations for ResponseFactory (this.prompt(), this.endSessionWith()), TranslateHelper (this.t()), platform/device recognition (getPlatform(), getDeviceOrPlatform()) and logging (this.logger)
- groups state interfaces to a State namespace (State.Required, State.ErrorHandler, State.BeforeIntent, ...)
- adds unique short requestId to RequestContext
- switches to production-ready logging through bunyan: Removes dependency of "debug" module, adding bunyan instead.
- makes bunyan instance configurable through "core:root"-configuration
- makes logger instance injectable in all classes (as well in root as in request scope)
- adds the current request's id, an unique session identifier (not the session id) and the current platform/device as default parameters to request-specific logger
- makes logging opt-in-able in specs via environment variable SPEC_LOGS=true
- enables component-specific logging (especially for external assistantjs components)
- adds extension point enabling other components to add middlewares to request-specific logger
- enables whitelisting of specific extraction elements with logger, uses reasonable secure default
- changes featureChecker to use type guards
- updates multiple dependencys (esp. typescript)
- changes structure of configuration interfaces to improve type safety and user handling, now seperating between Configuration.Defaults and Configuration.Required and deriving Configuration.Runtime and user configuration
- deprecates interface exports (rootInterfaces, servicesInterfaces, unifierInterfaces, ...), now exporting all interfaces directly
- restructures internal interfaces, splits them up into public-interfaces (which are exported) and private-interfaces (which aren't)
- moves all interfaces needed for platform generators into single PlatformGenerator namespace
- updates scaffolding to generate new 0.3.0 structures in generated projects
- adds interfaces for internal hooks, making them type-safe
- adds cli command to list extension points and components

version 0.2.7
- removes local references from package-lock.json
- adds default port to fakredis spec instance, bugfixing fast mode

version 0.2.6
- executes registerInternalComponents() only if not done already by developer, giving him/her more flexibility

version 0.2.5
- makes tests faster
- updates inversify-components
- uses fast-option for fakeredis in default configuration

version 0.2.4
- switches to fakeredis as default configuration, lowering the barriers to entry

version 0.2.3
- sample selection now prefers array syntax over template syntax:
  When translateHelper draws a translation, it first looks out for the translation array and grabs a sample,
  before evaluating the sample's template syntax. This changes the probabilities of translation entries.

version 0.2.2
- enhances platform-specific i18n translations
- enables i18n data models
- fixes bug causing filtering of all entities in logs

- introduces changelog
- adds redis configuration to scaffold
- removes redis default configuration
- removes redis dependency for assistant cli
